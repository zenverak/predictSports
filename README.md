# predictSports


The goal of this is to eventually predict outcomes of games. However, for now it also will rate teams in a league based on certain features.


For the future I would like to add the following features

* more sports leagues.
  * currently this only works with the NFL. However if I can find some API's similar to nflGame then I can get all of the data I need
* neural netowrk capability so that it will be able to predict
